Version Upgrade Notes
Some methods are no longer used in the new version.
These methods need to be replaced with their updated equivalents.
After updating, make sure to test the code.

A simple way to test is:
Find the file where the method is used → Right-click → Run Java object.

Since my current level isn’t enough to fully understand or write tests myself, this is a simple testing method that my senior taught me.
